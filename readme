This is a D3D11 driver for use with BlitzMax. www.blitzbasic.com

To use this driver you need to add 'srs.mod' folder into BlitzMax/mod folder, and copy these 3 folders ( with files ) into the new srs.mod folder.

For eg...
If you have installed BlitzMax to the default location then after copying the files/folders you should have the following structure:

C:/BlitzMax/mod/srs.mod/d3d11graphics.mod/[files here]
C:/BlitzMax/mod/srs.mod/d3d11max2d.mod/[files here]
C:/BlitzMax/mod/srs.mod/directx11.mod/[files here]

If you have any issues with this driver you can contact me in the BlitzMax forum here:
